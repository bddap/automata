# Preface

After reading the excellent book, "Game Programming Patterns" by Robert Nystrom, I created a toy program to experiment with concepts from the book.

This report: 

1. Documents the inner workings of the toy program.
2. Explains some patterns from Robert Nystrom's book and details their use in the program.
